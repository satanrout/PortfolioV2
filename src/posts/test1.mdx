We recently updated our list of the best smartphones in India priced under Rs. 15,000, and each model on that list is capable of handling the daily grind. However, if you want something that does a bit more without spending too much, this is the list to look at. The sub-Rs. 20,000 price segment is where you'll find phones with more powerful processors and even better cameras. After testing multiple smartphones, we have compiled a list of the best phones under Rs. 20,000. Even if you wish to spend less than Rs. 18,000, you will find some great phones on this list. These devices fared very well in our tests, making them easy to recommend. Check them out

One of the newest additions to the list and the Poco family, the Poco X2 checks most of our boxes. This device is tall and has a big 6.67-inch display with a 20:9 aspect ratio. The display also boasts of a 120Hz refresh rate which is a bonus. The Poco X2 has a dual-camera punch-hole on the front, and a side-mounted fingerprint scanner, both of which aren't common features. The Poco X2 feels large and bulky. It is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G which is a powerful chip that can handle gaming quite well.

The Poco X2 has multiple variants: 6GB of RAM with 64GB of storage, 6GB of RAM with 128GB of storage, and 8GB of RAM with 256GB of storage. All three were priced under Rs. 20,000 when first launched, but the recent GST hike has caused each variant of the Poco X2 to go up in price by Rs. 1,000. The base variant is now priced at 16,999, the middle one at Rs. 17,999, and the top variant is at 20,999,

Poco has packed in a 4,500mAh battery and you get a 27W charger in the box. This phone sports a quad-camera setup at the back and we noticed that the photo quality in daylight is quite good. Low-light photo quality was also relatively impressive but not as detailed as during the day. Low-light video quality wasn't as good.
